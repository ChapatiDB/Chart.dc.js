  > Just an overall note here that so far this chart extension has barely matured out of the experimental stage, the code has not been thoroughly analyzed or reviewed and there are no tools creating a pipeline for testing and building changes and code smell and bugs have not been worked out yet.

## Bugs, Feature Suggestions

* The best place for Bug and Feature suggestions is this repository's github issues page. The responsiveness will vary to any feature request as the code is not going to always be under active maintenance. 

## Pull Requests

* Fork the code into your own repository
* Update any source files as necessary, add yourself as a contributor to AUTHORS
* Commit your code and submit a pull request
* Code will be reviewed (this may take some time, see above explanation in the Bugs section), and a feedback loop will commence that eventually results in more amazing dc-compatible charts!
* For multiple pull requests from the same fork, please branch your git repository for each one.
